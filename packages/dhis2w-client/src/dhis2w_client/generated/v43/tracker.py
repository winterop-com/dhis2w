"""Typed models for DHIS2 v43 tracker instance data.

Thin shim over the OpenAPI-derived models under `generated/v43/oas/`. Re-exports
the wire-shape classes (`TrackerTrackedEntity`, `TrackerEnrollment`,
`TrackerEvent`, `TrackerRelationship`, `TrackerRelationshipItem`,
`TrackerDataValue`, `TrackerAttribute`, `TrackerNote`) plus the status enums
(`EnrollmentStatus`, `EventStatus`), and defines the client-side `TrackerBundle`
wrapper used for `POST /api/tracker` (not in OpenAPI — it's the wire envelope
DHIS2 accepts for bulk writes).

DHIS2 v43's OpenAPI exposes the event schema under the redundant name
`TrackerTrackerEvent` (vs `TrackerEvent` in v42). The alias below keeps the
public name `TrackerEvent` stable across versions; see DHIS2_ISSUES.md for the
upstream naming quirk.

    """Typed payload for `POST /api/tracker` — any mix of tracker objects in one atomic write.

    DHIS2 accepts nested construction (a tracked entity carrying its own
    `enrollments[]` which carry their own `events[]`) or flat construction
    (all four arrays populated independently). Callers pick whichever fits
    their data shape; DHIS2 collapses both forms server-side.

    Produce the wire payload with
    `bundle.model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True, mode="json")`.
    Bundle fields are typed lists of the OpenAPI-derived tracker models, so
    enum fields like `EventStatus.COMPLETED` validate at construction time.

    Not in the OpenAPI spec — `POST /api/tracker` is documented but the
    request body shape is described only in prose. This class is a
    hand-written mirror of that shape.
