"""Local patches applied to DHIS2's OpenAPI spec before emission.

DHIS2's springdoc-generated `openapi.json` has known gaps — polymorphic
`oneOf` unions emitted without a discriminator block, variant schemas
missing the Jackson `type` tag, etc. Every such gap has an entry in
`BUGS.md` awaiting an upstream fix.

This module is how we patch around them locally: each `SpecPatch` runs
against the in-memory `components.schemas` dict and mutates it into what
the spec *should* have been. The normal OAS emitter then sees a clean,
idiomatic spec and produces properly-typed pydantic models.

Each patch is idempotent — it checks whether its fix already exists in
the input and short-circuits if upstream has landed a proper fix. When
that happens the patch becomes a no-op and can be retired.

Every patch carries a `bugs_ref` pointer so the log output names which
gap was worked around, and the `BUGS.md` entry stays synced with the
patch.
